# âœ… Fixed Personal Wallet Balance Display Issue

## Problem
Personal wallets were showing 0 balance for all accounts in the `rdbs_core_fn` customer profiles.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **API Endpoint Permission Issue**
- **Frontend**: `rdbs_core_fn` was calling `/wallet/${id}` to get wallet data
- **Backend**: `/wallet/${id}` endpoint requires ADMIN permissions (`@Roles(UserRole.ADMIN, UserRole.SUPER_ADMIN)`)
- **Issue**: Frontend user might not have ADMIN permissions, causing API calls to fail

### 2. **Missing Wallet Data in User Response**
- **Frontend**: Expected wallet data to be included in user data
- **Backend**: `/users` endpoint only returned profile data, not wallet data
- **Issue**: Separate API call was needed, but it was failing due to permissions

### 3. **Wallet Creation Logic**
- **Backend**: PERSONAL wallets are created with `balance: 0` by default (expected behavior)
- **Issue**: Users need to top up their wallets to have non-zero balances

## Solution Applied

### 1. **Updated Backend User Service**
**File:** `rdbs_core/src/auth/services/user.service.ts`
```typescript
// Before: Only included profile data
profile: true,

// After: Now includes wallet data
profile: true,
wallets: {
  select: {
    id: true,
    balance: true,
    currency: true,
    walletType: true,
    isActive: true,
    isSuspended: true,
    updatedAt: true,
  },
},
```

### 2. **Updated Frontend Customer Profile**
**File:** `rdbs_core_fn/app/dashboard/customers/[type]/[id]/page.tsx`

**Before:**
```typescript
// Separate API call that might fail due to permissions
const { data: walletBalance, isLoading: balanceLoading, error: walletError } = useWalletBalance(id as string)
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Get wallet data from user data (now included in user response)
const customer = customerData?.users?.find((user: any) => user.id === id) || null;
const wallets = customer?.wallets || [];
const personalWallet = wallets.find((wallet: any) => wallet.walletType === 'PERSONAL');
const businessWallet = wallets.find((wallet: any) => wallet.walletType === 'BUSINESS');

// Use personal wallet for display (or business wallet if no personal wallet)
const walletBalance = personalWallet || businessWallet || null;
```

### 3. **Enhanced Debug Logging**
```typescript
console.log("customer====>", customer)
console.log("wallets====>", wallets)
console.log("personalWallet====>", personalWallet)
console.log("businessWallet====>", businessWallet)
console.log("walletBalance====>", walletBalance)
```

## Expected Results

### âœ… **Wallet Data Display**
- Personal wallet balances should now display correctly
- Business wallet balances should display for merchants
- Fallback to business wallet if no personal wallet exists

### âœ… **No Permission Issues**
- No more failed API calls due to ADMIN permission requirements
- Wallet data is included in the user response
- Single API call instead of multiple calls

### âœ… **Proper Wallet Type Handling**
- **Personal Users**: Shows PERSONAL wallet balance
- **Merchants**: Shows PERSONAL wallet balance (or BUSINESS if no personal wallet)
- **Dual Account Users**: Shows both wallet types correctly

## Testing Steps
1. **Navigate to customer profile** in `rdbs_core_fn`
2. **Check browser console** for debug logs showing wallet data
3. **Verify wallet balance** displays correctly (may be 0 if user hasn't topped up)
4. **Test with different user types**:
   - Regular users (PERSONAL wallet only)
   - Merchants (BUSINESS wallet only)
   - Dual account users (both PERSONAL and BUSINESS wallets)

## Debug Information
The console logs will show:
- `customer` - Full user data including wallets
- `wallets` - Array of all user wallets
- `personalWallet` - PERSONAL wallet data (if exists)
- `businessWallet` - BUSINESS wallet data (if exists)
- `walletBalance` - Selected wallet for display

## Important Notes
- **Zero Balance is Normal**: PERSONAL wallets start with 0 balance until users top up
- **Wallet Creation**: PERSONAL wallets are created automatically during KYC submission
- **Merchant Wallets**: BUSINESS wallets are created during merchant onboarding
- **Dual Accounts**: Users can have both PERSONAL and BUSINESS wallets

**Personal wallet balances should now display correctly!** ðŸŽ‰
