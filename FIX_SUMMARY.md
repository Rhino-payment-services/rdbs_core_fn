# âœ… Fixed Customer Type Display Issue

## Problem
User "Ngabo Sevelin" was showing as "MERCHANT" type in the Subscribers tab instead of "SUBSCRIBER".

## Root Cause
The `getUserTypeBadge` function in `CustomerTable.tsx` was checking for `merchantCode` to determine if someone is a merchant, regardless of which tab they're displayed on.

## Solution
Modified `getUserTypeBadge` to always show the actual `userType` (SUBSCRIBER) instead of checking for `merchantCode`.

## Changes Made
1. **Fixed Building2 import** - Added missing `Building2` import to prevent runtime error
2. **Fixed type display logic** - Users now show correct type based on their actual `userType`

## Expected Result
- **Subscribers tab**: Shows "SUBSCRIBER" type for all individual users (including dual account users)
- **Merchants tab**: Shows "MERCHANT" type explicitly (handled by `isMerchantTab` flag)
- **Dual account users**: Appear in both tabs with correct types

## Test Steps
1. Refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Go to Customers page
3. Search for "ngabo" 
4. Check Subscribers tab - should show "SUBSCRIBER" type
5. Check Merchants tab - should show "MERCHANT" type

Both tabs should now display the correct user types! ðŸŽ‰
