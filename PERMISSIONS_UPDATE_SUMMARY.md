# Permissions Update Summary

## Overview
Added comprehensive permission guards to Transaction Modes and Products pages to ensure users only see and access features they have permissions for.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend Permissions (`rdbs_core_fn`)

#### Added New Permissions Constants
**File:** `lib/hooks/usePermissions.ts`
- Added `PRODUCTS_VIEW`: View products and configurations
- Added `PRODUCTS_CREATE`: Create new products
- Added `PRODUCTS_UPDATE`: Update existing products
- Added `PRODUCTS_DELETE`: Delete products

#### Updated Navigation Bar
**File:** `components/dashboard/Navbar.tsx`
- Changed Products menu link to use `PRODUCTS_VIEW` permission
- Transaction Modes already had `TRANSACTION_MODES_VIEW` permission guard

#### Transaction Modes Page (`app/dashboard/transaction-modes/page.tsx`)
**Permission Guards Added:**
1. **Page-Level Access:**
   - Users without `TRANSACTION_MODES_VIEW` permission see "Access Denied" message
   - Redirects to dashboard with clear error message

2. **Action Buttons:**
   - "Create Mode" button: Only visible if user has `TRANSACTION_MODES_CREATE`
   - "Edit" button: Only visible if user has `TRANSACTION_MODES_UPDATE`
   - "Delete" button: Only visible if user has `TRANSACTION_MODES_DELETE`
   - "Activate/Deactivate" button: Only visible if user has `TRANSACTION_MODES_UPDATE`
   - System-defined modes cannot be edited/deleted (additional protection)

#### Products Page (`app/dashboard/products/page.tsx`)
**Permission Guards Added:**
1. **Page-Level Access:**
   - Users without `PRODUCTS_VIEW` permission see "Access Denied" message
   - Redirects to dashboard with clear error message

2. **Action Buttons:**
   - "Create Product" button: Only visible if user has `PRODUCTS_CREATE`
   - "Edit" button: Only visible if user has `PRODUCTS_UPDATE`
   - "Delete" button: Only visible if user has `PRODUCTS_DELETE`

### 2. Backend Permissions (`rdbs_core`)

#### Created Product Permissions Seed
**File:** `prisma/seeds/seed-product-permissions.ts`
- Creates 4 product permissions: VIEW, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE
- Assigns to roles:
  - **SUPER_ADMIN**: All permissions (VIEW, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - **ADMIN**: All permissions (VIEW, CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - **MANAGER**: VIEW only
  - **SUPPORT**: No permissions by default (assign via API)

**To Run Seed:**
```bash
cd rdbs_core
npx ts-node prisma/seeds/seed-product-permissions.ts
```

## Permission Matrix

| Role        | Transaction Modes | Products | Notes |
|-------------|-------------------|----------|-------|
| SUPER_ADMIN | Full Access       | Full Access | All CRUD operations |
| ADMIN       | Full Access       | Full Access | All CRUD operations |
| MANAGER     | VIEW only         | VIEW only | Read-only access |
| SUPPORT     | No access*        | No access* | Assign via permissions management |

*Custom roles can be assigned specific permissions via the permissions management API

## User Experience

### With Permissions:
- Users see navigation menu items for features they have access to
- Create/Edit/Delete buttons appear based on specific permissions
- Clean, intuitive interface showing only what they can use

### Without Permissions:
- Navigation menu items are hidden (not just disabled)
- Page shows "Access Denied" with clear message if accessed directly
- "Back to Dashboard" button for easy navigation
- No action buttons visible on pages they can view

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with SUPER_ADMIN:**
   - Should see all menu items
   - Should see all action buttons
   - Full CRUD operations work

2. **Test with MANAGER:**
   - Should see Transaction Modes and Products in menu
   - Should NOT see Create/Edit/Delete buttons
   - Can view data only

3. **Test with SUPPORT:**
   - Should NOT see Transaction Modes or Products in menu
   - Direct URL access shows "Access Denied"
   - Can be granted permissions via permissions management

## Database Changes

The permissions have been seeded to the database. If you need to refresh:
```bash
cd rdbs_core
npx ts-node prisma/seeds/seed-transaction-mode-permissions.ts
npx ts-node prisma/seeds/seed-product-permissions.ts
```

## Next Steps

1. **Refresh your browser** to load the updated frontend
2. **Test with different user roles** to verify permission guards
3. **Use permissions management** to assign custom permissions to specific roles/users

## Custom Role Configuration

To assign permissions to custom roles, use the permissions management API:

```bash
POST /api/permissions/assign
{
  "roleId": "custom-role-id",
  "permissionIds": ["permission-id-1", "permission-id-2"]
}
```

Available permission names:
- `TRANSACTION_MODES_VIEW`
- `TRANSACTION_MODES_CREATE`
- `TRANSACTION_MODES_UPDATE`
- `TRANSACTION_MODES_DELETE`
- `PRODUCTS_VIEW`
- `PRODUCTS_CREATE`
- `PRODUCTS_UPDATE`
- `PRODUCTS_DELETE`
